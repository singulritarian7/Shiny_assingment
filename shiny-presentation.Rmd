## Shiny Presentation

The presentation includes:

- Introduction
- A table of the data
- An overview of tha web app
- Links and notes

## Inroduction

In this app we study the relationship between two variables, carat and price of the dataset diamonds, that yoy can find loading ggplot2. With a subset of the datframe we can also observe the predicted values of price. Notice that ib the difeerent tabs you can find interactive plots and tables.
